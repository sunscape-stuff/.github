# Sunscape

Sunscape is an organization that was created to house all of my development for the Poco X3 NFC.

In here, you'll find my [builds](https://github.com/sunscape-stuff/builds), kernel sources, device trees, dependencies and all of the manifests that had to be modified in order to make these builds easier to bring to the community.
